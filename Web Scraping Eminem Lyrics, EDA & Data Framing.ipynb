If somebody got three and a half, yeah, you know, you wouldn\\'t know, but their word was gold and it was usually right.

I could have done this better or that better!' And I'll work it to death. Obviously if I wasn't comfortable with it, I wouldn't put it out.

A lot of songs that people probably will never hear. We hit a couple of road blocks. There were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever.

Because when I got sober it was like – I\\'ve said this before – but it just was like \"Oh shit! I can think straight again!\" So I don\\'t know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion.

One of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had choruses on them. It\\'s kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else\\'s hook and kind of interpret the words. Because my own hooks, I already know what I mean when I write them. The way that I do music is, like, regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have, I always want to try to go as hard lyrically as I can.

So we just sat down and started picking shit out and I would start writing to them and next time I'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it. The dude's got so many ideas, man. One of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the Rick Rubin scratches. When he fucking scratches some shit, it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it. Not that it's off-time or anything like that, but it's just like – it's fucking weird. I don't even know how to explain it. You just know that he scratched it. I don't know if that even makes sense or not. It's like a simple scratch, like a basic kind of thing, but it's so fucking dope when you hear it. It's just, it's vintage him.

In mid-2007, he called in to Angie Martinez’s show on New York radio station Hot 97 to say he was “in limbo” and “debating” whether to release another album . Then, in January of this year, news broke that he had been rushed to a Detroit-area hospital for complications related to pneumonia , and in at least one of those reports, sources were quoted as saying his weight had exceeded 200 lbs.',\n",

And he’s living a reclusive lifestyle in an attempt to hide his new body” — had fans worried about Eminem. But 50, who in recent weeks has battled rumors about his own weight thanks to online photos that show him looking extra gaunt, said that those worries are unfounded. According to him, Em’s fine and in fighting shape (or at least, balling shape).',\n",
