My final Natural Language Processing (NLP) Capstone project for the GA-DSI 10 cohort!

Using Keras I set up a Recurrent Neural Network to generate lyrics based on a corpus of Eminem songs.

The Eminem song lyrics were obtained through webscraping with the geniuslyrics API found here: https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius
